                <p>I'm a current JavaScript bootcamp student at Grand Circus Detroit striving to hone my technical skills in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In addition to front-end development, I am well-versed in public relations, marketing, advertising and project management. I'm passionate about the web, exploring new technologies and solving complex challenges.</p>

                <p>Throughout my career, I’ve launched publicity campaigns for buzzing indie musicians, helped seniors celebrate their golden years, announced multi-million dollar real estate developments and helped America’s oldest detective agency reinvent themselves for the 21st Century.</p>

              <section><p>I am a JavaScript Developer writing clean, expressive and maintainable code focused on solving problems. I have the ability to quickly learn new languages, frameworks and skills to contribute as an effective member of any team. </p>

              <p>As a small business owner and endurance athletics coach I understand the value of efficiency, using an analytical approach to decision making and training plan construction. I view each athlete and their individual goals as a problem to be solved, prescribing workouts to create the appropriate stimuli for each athlete's needs. </p>

              <p>To date I have coached eight first time Ironman athletes across the finish line with a 100% completion rate. I have also coached athletes of other disciplines to state championships, overall series victories and numerous personal bests. I am confident I can bring that same level of success to your team and organization.</p></section>

              <section><p>Creating beauty and functionality out of code and chaos, that is my passion.  I love engaging the imagination and finding new and innovative ways to upgrade the digital experience that is the world wide web.  With well over a decade of hands-on experience in web design and development, usability, content management, and interface design, I am looking to find my next challenge!</p>  

<p>My primary background has been in the Defense, Healthcare, and the Automotive industries but my passion has always been using design to share information and engage the end-user, taking a casual visitor and making them an active participant.</p>

<p>Let's work together to make a better digital world!</p></section>
